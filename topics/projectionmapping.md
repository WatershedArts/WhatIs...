What Is ... Projection Mapping
===

### Summary
Projection mapping is where everyday projectors are used to put visual content on to a variety of surfaces.

Projection Mapping Central have a [wonderful illustrated history](
http://projection-mapping.org/the-history-of-projection-mapping/) of projection mapping.

Aside from these some of the earliest examples of projection mapping can be seen in the work of Czech theatre designer Josef Svoboda.

In the work of Charles and Ray Eames.

In each of these examples the images are being carefully projected onto a defined surface.

I use the term surface loosely as most things can be considered a surface.

Some projects have projected onto surfaces such as walls, breathe, clouds, fountains, people, robots and so on.

### Types
Projection Mapping comes in two guises. 

### Static 
Where the projection surfaces are fixed.

**McGuires - Icebook**

### Dynamic 
Where the surfaces change and the content can (though not always) react to the movement. For instance we can think of projection mapping performers as a dynamic mapping.

## Uses
Where projection mapping could be useful in ...

* Performance: performers, stage objects etc... Greg Gieskam's book [Staging the Screen](https://he.palgrave.com/page/detail/Staging-the-Screen/?K=9781403916983) has a really wonderful history of video in theatre in it. Let me know if you want to borrow it.
* Most Projects - We have used a form of projection mapping in at least two of the Playable City Projects.

## Gotchas

* Time - time of day, time of year.
* Projectors - brightness, power, contrast, connections, serial connections for remote starting.
* Locations - how far you are away from the surface, are there things obstructing the , what color is the surface,
* Occulusion - will people block the projector.

## Resources
Basic resources to get started with the Projection Mapping.

### Tools
* [MadMapper](http://madmapper.com/)
**Recommmended** tool that makes the process of getting content mapped easier and quicker. Both Windows and MacOSX. It also allows you to make generative content inside the application. Free Trial with watermark.

* [VDMX](http://vidvox.net/)
* [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/)
* [d3technologies](https://www.d3technologies.com/en/)

### Content Creation

You do not need specialist software to create content for mapping.

You can use: 

* Adobe After Effects
* Any Video Editing Package
* [Resolume](https://resolume.com/)
* [VDMX](http://vidvox.net/)
* [Modul8](http://www.modul8.ch/)
* [Pixel Conduit](http://pixelconduit.com/index.html)
* [2VP](9http://www.2v-p.tv/)
* [Millumin](http://www.millumin.com/v2/index.php)
* Custom Software. (Most Projection Mapping Tools usually give you the opportunity to use [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) or [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/) which are frameworks for sharing pixels across applications)

## Hints
When you have a difficult surface to map, it is worth making a 2d model of the space from the projectors perspective.

The best way to do this is to use something similar to MSPaint / Pixelmator / Photoshop. Make your window full screen on the projectors output. Now pick out features that can orientate / be identified by drawing a thin line around the item. Export the image now you have a ready made template to start mapping with.

Software such as MadMapper have in built Spatial Scanners that use a Canon Camera to photograph the projectors perspective.

*Lasers

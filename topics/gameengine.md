What Is ... a Game Engine?
===

## Summary

A game engine is a software framework / application designed for the creation of video games. However, they are not limited by to this task. Game engines can be used for other creative applications. 

### What makes a game engine?

There are many components to a game engine. For example.

* Render Engine
* Physics Engine
* Animation
* Scripting / Logic Engine
* Audio Engine
* Memory Management
* Networking Engine
* Artificial Intelligence Engine

Each game engine will have different ways of implementing each of these smaller engines.

### Which engine is best?

This depends on your requirements and your teams skill level.

### Engines

There are many different variety of game engines. Some are built by game companies from the ground up and are closed off from the public domain, there are many engines that are either free or that ask for a percentage from the game's revenue. 

For Example:

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)
* [Cryengine](https://www.cryengine.com/)
* [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4)
* [Decima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decima_(game_engine))
* [Game Salad](https://gamesalad.com/)
* [id Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_engine)
* [RAGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine)
* [Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil_(game_engine))
* [RPGMaker](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/)
* [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker)

However, people can build they're own engines for specific games. For instance Hello Games built an engine from scratch specifically for No Mans Sky.

We wrote a special game engine for the New Talent residencies last year where users could drop in pinball table artworks and the engine would generate a unique game environment from the art.

Example.

However, this was written in c++, but game engines do not need to be incredible bits of software that do everything you can customise your own.

What Is... Computer Vision

**WARNING: This What is... contains far too many acronyms**

## Summary
What is computer vision? 

In laymenâ€™s terms, it is the field of allowing computers to process and understand visual data be that digital images of videos.

OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) is the most popular library of functions which focuses on image analysis, processing and evaluation. It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces ie libraries for each language. It is supported by Windows, Linux, Android, iOS and MacOS

OpenCV is used in a range of products and computing systems, such as the field of robotics, Virtual Reality, Automonous Cars, Augmented Reality and ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition). It has more than 2500 algorithms that can perform tasks such as recognizing faces, identifying objects, track moving objects and stiching images together. One way you can think about OpenCV in a reductive way is like the filters in Photoshop.

So there are a number of subsystems / modules of OpenCV well just talk about them in high level.

#### Subsystems

* Image Enhancement
* Transformations
* Filtering
* Color Vision
* Feature Extraction
* Pose Estimation
* Registration
* Visual Recognition

## Common Uses
Ok so there are alot of modules and subsystems that we can get lost in here. Lets focus on a few of the more common tasks and uses of OpenCV.

* Background Subtraction
* Filtering
* Tracking
* Feature Detection
	* Corner Detection
	* SIFT
	* SURF
	* FAST
	* ORB
	* BRIEF
	* Template Matching

## Gotchas
* Lighting: Lighting affects OpenCV using normal cameras. If you use IR / depth cameras lighting isnt so much of an issue.
* Sunlight and Shadow: Especially if you are using OpenCV outdoors. There are ways to combat this such as MOG Filters.
* Occulusion: People covering the camera
* Camera Choice: poor cameras will result in poor image quality.
* Poorly Optimized Systems: I've been guilty of this before and it haunted me afterward. Make sure your system does only what you need.
* Speed: Be smart about what you are looking at. Do you need to be capturing and analysing images at 1080p 30 frames a second. Could you do it at half the resolution.
